Eekee's personal user code for SBTCVM Mark 2.
This is all the stuff; whatever I'm working on, have worked on, 
will work on, would like to work on, 
or may work on on the day the existence of avian porcines is confirmed.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/eekee/SBCTVM_Mk2_VMUSER/wiki)
for releases of actual usable code.

NOTES.txt is basically all my notes-to-self.
Filenames in relative paths
are very convenient with Acme 
or other text editors which support opening links in the text.
Some operating systems support text links as a system feature, 
notably Oberon and Plan 9.
