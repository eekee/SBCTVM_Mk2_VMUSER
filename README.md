Eekee's personal user code for SBTCVM Mark 2.
This is all the stuff; whatever I'm working on, have worked on, 
will work on, would like to work on,

NOTES.txt is basically all my notes-to-self.

In NOTES.txt, filenames in relative paths
are very convenient with the Acme text editor.
They may also be useful with other editors which support 
opening links in the text, or when copy/paste is convenient.
