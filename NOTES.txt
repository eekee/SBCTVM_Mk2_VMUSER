@ WANTED

not asking, keeping track of what i hope i can add some day.

~ CISCing it up to save instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* shifts, especially because divide rounds wrong for some uses.
	defeating wrong rounding requires 3-4 instructions 
	to truncate before division.
* immediate arithmetic ops, adddata subdata muldata divdata, 
	to save using reg2 and the instruction loading it.
	very common case, would save a lot.
	in this architecture, this covers increment and decrement too.

~ interruptable wait
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
probably the simplest key to sane interrupt handling.
see 'threading' in the next section.
or maybe rom switching could make it easier without this.

~ save trom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
probably the simplest way to get permanent storage.
it'll overwrite, preserving data is the user's responsibility.
i use git, or files can be copied of course, and in case of 
disaster the original trom can be restored by assembling again.
maybe a menu entry, "save trom (overwrite)".
what does it do with multiple troms though?

then i thought of using multiple troms like disks. 
i'd want to save a particular trom or troms without 
error-prone menu picking every time.
so i'd want to save by program command, not menu.

~ disassembler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
to go with saving the trom. apart from disassembly itself, 
its most useful function may be finding strings in the trom, 
and translating them to ascii.
i'm thinking it could remember the last data cells so long as 
every one corresponds to a character. when non-character data 
is encountered, if more than n cells are saved, they are written 
into the disassembly in a format similar to textstart/textstop.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ HOWTO

techniques more than hardware access.

~ emulate indirect addressing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
stack1.tasm does it like this:
	romread1;>stacktop
	setdata;>stackpushme
	romread1;>stackreg1bak
	setdata;000000000;stackpushme
pt* are probably better.
	see -asm.txt (which is now updated with them) and 
	../ROMS/testmempt.tasm
	not very much better. it's another register, which is nice, 
	but barely saves any instructions.
	

~ jumps, loops, conditionals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
so important i'm putting them here.
cmd|data|label
	define label. data required in this case.
gotodata|>label
	obvious
gotoreg1
	register index yay!
	not used in any stock roms. works fine though.
gotodataif|>label
	jump if reg1 == reg2
gotoifgreater|>label
	jump if reg1 > reg2
../ROMS/addloop.tasm
stack1.tasm:/stackdump

~ copy memory region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
? :)


~ trit manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
offsetlen
	../ROMS/testoffsetlen.tasm
	../textdocs/programming-the-VM/SBTCVM-asm.txt:/offsetlen
	../textdocs/programming-the-VM/offsetlength.txt
offsetlen.tasm
new description:
["offsetlen"
-0-++0
defines a masking window, only trits visible 
through the window are written to the destination.

usage:
	offsetlen|A,B,C
if A is "off", the remaining trits in the destination are preserved.
if it is "on", they are overwritten with 0.
B is the offset for the window's low-value edge (the right side).
C is the size of the window, the length extending toward high values.
affected operations are read and write to IO and memory.
the window remains active until reset with "offsetlen|off,0,9".
see also: romread* setdata IOread* IOwrite*
]
truncation may be greater than the number of chars without affecting it.
to compute the offset code:
	????ABBCC
	A: 0=off; +=on
	B: subtract 4 (0000000++) from desired offset
	C: subtract 5 (000000+--) from desired length
but see offsetlength.txt when it's not a straight number; e.g. linear pixel number.

~ threading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
this seemed like something i wasn't going to bother with, 
until i realised it might be a way around the problems with 
interrupts. maybe all the key input could be handled by 
one thread, (the main thread is the only one which can,)
while all the actual action happens in another thread.
nnnope! you have to have a running mainloop -- no "wait" -- 
for key interrupts to work properly, and that would halve the 
speed of the other thread.

~ scratch memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
how much is there? 729 words.
it's at the lowest addresses on the iobus, from --------- to ---++++++.
	these locations are aliased by labels "mem1" to "mem729".
can it be used for communication between multiple loaded troms?
	interesting question!

@ KEYBOARD

interrupt per key only, i think. ridiculous, but not painful.
available keys: 
	1-9 + - a-z space enter

reuse or reference ../ROMS/keytest.tasm , it's got all the keys.
i may as well write python code to generate my own keyboard interrupt table.

DOC BUG:
../textdocs/programming-the-VM/keyboard-inter.txt
	does not give the asm names.
	(it's not a useful document for me until i want to write an assembler)

@ FRAMEBUFFER GRAPHICS

choice of low res or very low res. :)
low res:
* 114 x 81 x 1-trit mono = 9234 trits = 5% of a 'rom'
* 114 x 81 x 3 trit color = 27702 trits = 16% of a 'rom'
very low res:
* _ x _ x 1-trit mono = _ trits = _% of a 'rom'

requires explicit update. see a generated trom.

~ tritmaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
how to copy?
there are pointer operations using r1. i'm sure it's possible using this.

~ drawing text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
there's not much room.
6x7 pixel chars = 19x11 colsXrows
6x8 = 19x10
6x6 = 19x13

~ expansionism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i thought of taking the low res mono and 3x3-ing it.
it would take up half (47%) of a 'rom'.
it might be reasonable if one 'rom' is a display server.
it would allow 57x34 or 57x30 chars, depending on 6x7 or 6x8 char cell.
non-square pixels might be more reasonable, but all this is still underwhelming.
another trick: 2 trits encoding 3 pixels. i'm sure i'd hate it. :)

114 is not a great width for 1tpp, it's not a multiple of 9.
243 is, and it's only just over double.
the corresponding vertical resolution would be 173 (or maybe 172).
such a mode would take 4671 words, or 23% of a rom. large, but not impossible.
with 2:3 pixels, it would have 115 lines and take 3105 words, 16%. 
same as 3-trit color!
