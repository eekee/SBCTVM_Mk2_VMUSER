need to fix asm doc, hence my copy.
would also like to fix assembler, it doesn't check syntax.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ HOWTO

techniques, not hardware access.

~ jumps, loops, conditionals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
so important i'm putting them here.
cmd|data|label
	define label. data required in this case.
gotodata|>label
	obvious
gotoreg1
	register index yay!
	not used in any roms.
gotodataif|>label
	jump if reg1 == reg2
gotoifgreater|>label
	jump if reg1 > reg2
../ROMS/addloop.tasm

~ copy memory region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
? :)

@ PROGRAMS

ideas and actual work, the latter marked with '$'.
to-do marked with '>'.

~ stock code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ trit input
	tritin.tasm
	> fix namespace
$ stack
	vital! there is no stack and only single-level return. (continue.tasm)
	already in very simple programs i'm finding 
	i need to quickly save vars all the time.
	$ stack1.tasm -- base with tests
	> mostly done. working on stack dump.
	- stack2.tasm -- interactive with tritin
7-seg display
	for easy score display in games
string handling
	input from keyboard
	output to tty
	trits<->string conversion
	decimal<->string conversion

~ simple programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ character set display
	chars.tasm
	> working on paged number:character display.
calculator, tty display
calculator, graphical display
clock, digital
	7-seg in the mini color display
clock, analogue
	easy enough with the vector graphics in the mini displays

~ games
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
simple: key response; single-pixel drawing; no timing; trivial generator
	robots
	black box
simple running as above, but perhaps more coding work
	hangman
		word list needs composition and several routines.
	unequal
	towers
	magnets
	unruly
	others from sgt puzzles
		all need cursor and/or x/y addressing.
other
	snake
		timing, key response, simple drawing
	moon buggy
		timing, key response, 'blitting' when the buggy jumps or crashes
	
get ideas for some above from bsd games:
	https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/games/
	i think snake game is 'worm'.
others from sgt puzzles:
	???

~ complex programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
forth
	forth.txt
text editor
	with the forth
binary computer emulator XD

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ KEYBOARD

interrupt per key only, i think. ridiculous, but not painful.
available keys: 
	1-9 + - a-z space enter

reuse or reference ../ROMS/keytest.tasm , it's got all the keys.
i may as well write python code to generate my own keyboard interrupt table.

DOC BUG:
../textdocs/programming-the-VM/keyboard-inter.txt
	does not give the asm names.
	(it's not a useful document for me until i want to write an assembler)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ FRAMEBUFFER GRAPHICS

choice of low res or very low res. :)
low res:
* 114 x 81 x 1-trit mono = 9234 trits = 5% of a 'rom'
* 114 x 81 x 3 trit color = 27702 trits = 16% of a 'rom'
very low res:
* _ x _ x 1-trit mono = _ trits = _% of a 'rom'

~ tritmaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
how to copy?
there are pointer operations using r1. i'm sure it's possible using this.

~ drawing text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
there's not much room.
6x7 pixel chars = 19x11 colsXrows
6x8 = 19x10

~ expansionism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i thought of taking the low res mono and 3x3-ing it.
it would take up half (47%) of a 'rom'.
it might be reasonable if one 'rom' is a display server.
it would allow 57x34 or 57x30 chars, depending on 6x7 or 6x8 char cell.
non-square pixels might be more reasonable, but all this is still underwhelming.
another trick: 2 trits encoding 3 pixels. i'm sure i'd hate it. :)

~ roms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../ROMS/invertdemo1.tasm
	writes to display memory
