test procedures for dict, which is complex enough that 
i don't want to rely on my memory and imagination while testing.

a	action
r	response
h	hidden response


a	start up
r	a light grey box appears in the mono plotter

a	type alpha, num, -, +
r	characters appear in the tty

a	type space or newline
r	the light grey box may visibly blink
r	in the case of newline, the tty should scroll 1 line

typing actions below implicitly end with "followed by space or newline".

== interpreting state (outside 'def' states) ==

a	type a word you previously defined
r	the word's definition is printed to the tty

a	type an undefined word
r	'?' is printed to the tty

a	type 'def'
h	enter 'def name' state
r	mono plotter may blink, then should show a light grey box

== def name state ==

a	type '-d-'
r	'name?' is printed to the tty

a	type any other word (even 'def')
h	enter 'def definition' state
r	mono plotter may blink, then should show a light grey box

== def definition state ==

a	type '-d-'
h	definition is interned in the dictionary
h	enter 'interpreting' state
r	mono plotter may blink, then should show a light grey box

a	type any other word
h	word with its trailing space or newline is entered into the current definition
r	mono plotter may blink, then should show a light grey box
