common words translated for limited keys:
	:	def
	;	ok
	'	qu
	[']	quo
	.	d
	.s	ds
	"	str	read to '++s--', or read to '+' unless escaped with '-' or something.
	."	dstr	ditto
could instead make a key act as a shift toggle, but ugh! :)

only 40 different chars can be entered by the keyboard.
can i use that to simply pack a name into a smaller space?
of course. do i want to? yes, memory is tight and cpu not too quick.
prolly good to restrict to alpha only. 3 trits mcv is 27, for 26 chars and null.
	1 data cell would hold 3 chars only. 3 cells, 9 chars. that's all right.

what's the normal string representation?
1 char per cell, 96 chars from mnv up.
only 40 keys supported: a-z + - space enter.
given mni of 6 trits (upper 3 trits ignored):
	'a' to 'z'	mni to mni+25	-364 to -339	------ to ---++0
	'-' 		mni+74  		-290			--++-+
	'+' 		mni+77  		-287			--++0+
	enter   	mni+94  		-270			-0-000
	space   	mni+95  		-269			-0-00+

forth source could be entered into the rom with 
"textstart"..."textstop", just don't call it! :)
any other text can too.
